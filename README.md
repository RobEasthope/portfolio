# Remix on Vercel Edge Functions

This is a demo of Remix running on Vercel Edge Functions (https://remix-on-the-edge.vercel.app/).

- Streaming SSR: Dynamically stream content with both Node.js and Edge runtimes
- API Routes: Easily build your serverless API with Remix and a route `loader`
- Advanced Caching: Use powerful cache headers like `stale-while-revalidate`
- Data Mutations: Run `actions` inside Serverless/Edge Functions
